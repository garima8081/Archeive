📞 Predicting Telecom Customer Churn
Using SPSS and Logistic Regression
🧩 Project Overview

This project aims to predict telecom customer churn by analyzing two integrated datasets — customer_info.csv and using_billing.csv — using SPSS and Logistic Regression.
The study helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services and take proactive retention actions.

🎯 Objectives

using_billing.csv — Includes usage and billing patterns.

🧠 Methodology

Data Integration: Merged datasets using customer ID as a key.

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, handled outliers, and standardized data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used SPSS for descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Model Building: Applied Logistic Regression in SPSS to predict churn probability.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences)

Logistic Regression

Excel / CSV (for data integration and cleaning)

📊 Results & Insights
